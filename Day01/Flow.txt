Introduction to JavaScript
=> JavaScript run on browser, browsers have engines that parses the script called JavaScript Engines
	V8 in Chrome, Opera and Edge
	Spider Monkey in Firefox
	Chakra in Internet Explorer
	
How does engine work?
	1. engine reads/parses the script.
	2. compiles/converts the script to machine code.
	3. and machine code runs pretty fast.
	
In browser JS doesnot have low-level access to memory, that is why it is called safe programming language. But in case of Node.js it has memory read-write access in files and databases...

<---- Code Structure ---->
 -> alert("Hello"); alert("World");
 -> alert("Hello") alert("World")
 -> alert(3+1+2); => 6
 -> alert("Hello") [1,2].forEach(alert); => alert + error
 -> alert("Hello"); [1,2].forEach(alert); => better => Hello -> 1 -> 2
 
<---- Variables in JS ---->
let/var ------>>
 let x = "Hello"; => String
 x = 20; => Number
There is slight difference between let and var
==> Data types in JS
 -> Number => let n = 10;
 	     n = 12.567;
 	     n = 1/0; or n = Infinity; => Infinity(∞);
 	     n = "str"/2; or n = (NaN/2); => NaN(Not a number)
 	          => Here's an exception --> n = NaN ** 0; => result is 1;
	     n = (9007199254740991 + 1); => 9007199254740992 => Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER = 9007199254740991
	     											(2^53 – 1)
	     n = (9007199254740991 + 2); => 9007199254740992
 
 -> String => let str = "Hello";
 		str = 'Single quotes are fine as well';
 		str1 = "a string" + "another string";
		str = "can embed with backquotes " + str1;
 		str = `can embed with backquotes ${str1}`;
 		
 -> Boolean => let isGreater = true;
 		isGreater = 4>1;

 -> Null => let age = null;
		It is a datatype which is "not a reference to a non-existing object/value". Infact it is a datatype which contains value that represents nothing.
		
 -> Undefined => let age;
		undeclared variable has a different datatype just like null.
		age = 10; age = undefined;(explicitly defining undefined to a variable)...

 -> typeof Operator => it is not a function
		typeof undefined; => undefined
		typeof 0 => number
		typeof 10n => bigint
		typeof(true) => boolean
		typeof(Math) => object
		typeof(null) => object
		typeof(alert) => function

Alert => mini modal window, user cannot interact with rest of the page
	alert("How old are you?");
Prompt => mini modal window with answer box
	let age = prompt("How old are you?", 100); => returns second argument, and passing 2nd arg is optional
	log(`${age}`); => 100
Confirm => mini modal window with question box. OK and Cancel buttons
	let isBoss = confirm("are you the boss?"); => return true or false, if OK is pressed returns true else false

Type Conversions
	alert("6"/"3"); => strings are converted to numbers
	let str = "123"; let x = "Cannot be converted into number";
	str = Number(str); x = Number(x); => NaN, conversion failed...
	log(typeof(str));
